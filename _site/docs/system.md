## System Architecture and Design
Student teams will present to the class a system architecture.
The key difference between the system architecture here and an overview of the system at the proposal stage is the level of detail. At the proposal stage, little details are needed. In the design stage, the team should provide details of the components and their interaction such as working with external files, accessing internal images, or communicating with entities over the internet. Again the exact architecture and design may evolve, but the team should be clear that they'd need the specified functionality.

The overall design should include:

- major components of the system
- interaction among the major components
- mockups of screens
- other artifacts to show how the system might work together.

A written report and an oral presentation are required. The report is expected 5-7 pages (2,000 to 2,500 words). The presentation is expected to be 15 minutes.



## Project Progress Reports and Presentations
While we will exchange information about the project at each of our weekly meetings, two formal progress reports and presentations are required during the semester (sometimes during the 5th week and the 10th week). The reports are expected to be 3-5 pages (1,200 to 1,500 words) and presentations about 15 minutes each. Each report should include the following:

- Current status of the project
- Team plan for the rest of the semester
- Any successful stories or difficulties during the past weeks
- Reflections of the team
