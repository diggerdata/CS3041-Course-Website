<h2 id="why-its-not-just-about-computer-science">Why it’s not just about Computer Science</h2>
<p>Every year that you have attended school, computers have been increasingly woven into the fabric of your everyday life. We don’t interact with computers simply when we sit in front of their screens anymore. They are in front of our faces when we eat dinner, telling us where to go when we drive our cars, and the medium through which we express many of our relationships.</p>

<p>This means that we can’t dismiss the quality of our interactions with these devices as something trivial or unimportant. Computers are simply too pervasive in our lives. <strong>The quality of our interactions with computers has a direct impact on our overall quality of life</strong>.</p>

<p>Practically, if you write an application that people can’t use, they won’t use it. Many of the dominant companies that we are familiar with received a jump start by emphasizing core usability principles in the beginning stages of development.</p>

<p>Given these stakes, we need to deeply consider <em>What is the best way for us to interact with computers? How can we quantify or capture this notion of ‘good design’? How can we build applications of our own that are designed well?</em> In this class, you will learn about:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Human-Centered Discovery:</em> Identify design problems that can be solved using computational means. This will allow you to develop ideas that fit actual human needs.</li>
  <li><em>Human-Centered Design Processes:</em> Develop a process for exploring and testing solutions to design issues. This will allow you to use research-validated approaches to creating apps that people find a pleasure to use.</li>
  <li><em>Research-Driven Design Solutions:</em> Utilize existing and emerging interaction techniques to improve the way that people engage with the world around them. This will allow you to develop a design intuition - using design ideas and principles to build user-centered applications.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, you will be exposed to people who are paving the way for the next-generation of HCI. Through them, I hope that you will catch a glimpse of the future, and use this information to grab ahold of trends before they emerge.</p>

<h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2>
<h3 id="participation-professionalism-and-critique">Participation, Professionalism, and Critique</h3>
<p>When the core content of a course involves people, engagement is absolutely critical. We will be doing design exercises in class, testing new software on each other, and providing critiques of each others’ work. This portion of your grade is significantly higher in HCI than some of your other courses for this very reason. Coffee up! It involves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Showing up to class</li>
  <li>Actively engaging in class activities</li>
  <li>Actively engaging in design critique of classmates</li>
  <li>Submitting good questions for our weekly visitors</li>
  <li>Occasional quiz on reading/video material</li>
  <li>Occasional reflection on class activities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reading-watching-listening">Reading, Watching, Listening</h3>
<p>While many HCI courses come with a standard text book, I believe that there is more than enough freely available information online.</p>

<p>Each week, our course schedule will contain a set of content you are asked to consume. Often this will involve short readings, YouTube videos, podcasts, or slide decks. My goal is to transform the lecture section of the course into a design studio as much as possible. While there will a lecture roughly once a week, talking through a million examples only gives you limited design capabilities. Iterating through, presenting, and critiquing each others’ designs is where you will really learn to build in a human-centered way.</p>

<p>Aside from internet sources, here are a few of the excellent books that we will be drawing from (I’ll link to restricted pdf excerpts). If you want to dive deeper, they are all freely available to borrow as ebooks from the Bucknell Library:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> by Jeff Johnson</li>
  <li><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> by Don Norman</li>
  <li><em>Human-Computer Interaction : An Empirical Research Perspective</em> by Scott MacKenzie</li>
  <li><em>Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design</em> by Bill Buxton</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I will give reading quizzes on this content.</strong></p>

<!-- ### Reports on Design
One of the goals of the course is for you to slowly begin to observe how people interact with the world around them, and how the way that we are designing our computers are helping or hurting us. As a result, I'll occasionally ask you to write about your analysis of usability testing or your experience in a design exercise or your observations on designs you see everyday.   
- Every student should create an account on [Medium](http://medium.com)
- For each group assignment, you will be asked to write a design reflection or report. **Please carefully [read this document](/docs/designdocs.html) to understand my expectations for these docs**
- While you are more than welcome to make it a public post, Medium also has an option that limits visibility of the post _only to people who have the link_. This will allow me and your classmates to see your writing, but will hide your work from search engines and the general public.
- You will submit the link of your post to the forum specified by the assignment. In general, this will either be Slack or our course wiki (hosted on Gitlab). -->

<h3 id="video-visitors--slack">Video Visitors | Slack</h3>
<p>HCI is a diverse field. It has computer scientists, psychologists, sociologists, historians, artists, and everything in between. Giving you one perspective (my perspective) would shed light on only a corner of an increasingly exciting field that is shaping how people engage with the world around them. As a result, each week we will have an opportunity to chat with people across this broad spectrum via Google Hangouts. What you need to do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Submit a question on Slack for our guest by 5pm the <em>day before</em> their visit.</li>
  <li>Before 8:30am the morning of their call, indicate which current questions on Slack that you like (with emoji, a comment, whatever). We will ask the top 3-5 questions submitted each week.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-sprints--course-overview">Design Sprints | Course Overview</h2>
<p>The core of the work in this class will fall under the broad category of “Design Modules” - worth 50% of your overall grade. While some of the following will be done entirely in class, other modules will be done in teams with more formal feedback mechanisms. Included below are a set of examples of what these design sprints might emphasize. <em>The following list will likely change over the course of the semester</em>. Your output for each of these modules will consist of a <a href="designdocs.html">design document</a></p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-design-portfolio">Final Design Portfolio</h2>
<p>At the end of the semester, each individual student will construct a website that acts as a design portfolio - linking to their work over the course of the semester. In addition, you will write a <em>design manifesto</em> that promotes a philosophy for design, as is evidenced by your work over the semester. <a href="manifesto.html">Read more details here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="grading-breakdown">Grading Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Participation and Critique:</strong> 20%</li>
  <li><strong>Modules:</strong> 50%</li>
  <li><strong>Reading Quizzes:</strong> 10%</li>
  <li><strong>Final Project:</strong> 20%</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If a student fails any single portion of the class, it is up to the instructor’s discretion whether the student should pass the course as a whole.</p>

<h3 id="grading-philosophy">Grading Philosophy</h3>
<p>For many of you, most CS assignments that you’ve had up until this point had clear, crisply defined goals that mapped cleanly to point values. This is impossible in a course that relies on design. Simply checking off each of the TODOs on an assignment does not necessarily mean that you’ve created something that is easy and compelling to use.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="designdoc_rubric.pdf"><strong>Design Document Rubric:</strong></a> A majority of your assignments will use this rubric. Rather than simply ask “Did you do this?”, there will also be the question of “Did you do this <em>well</em>?”. This often translates to “Did you successfully apply the concepts we learned in class to this assignment?”. For example, if you build an app that is functional but breaks many design heuristics… that is <strong>not</strong> a successful application in this class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Peer Evaluation:</strong> Many of the assignments that you complete will include some kind of peer evaluation. Usability isn’t a set of knowledge that one single person owns. Instead, software that is usable and works for one person may not for another. We will be critiquing each other’s work throughout the semester using the framing of <a href="https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/i-like-i-wish-what-if.pdf"><em>I Like, I Wish, What if</em></a> from Stanford’s design school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Group Work:</strong> Group work can be challenging. As a result, in each group project, you will submit a brief assessment of you and your classmates’ work. At the end of the semester, <strong>I may use these assessments to reweight the group portion of your grade (either positively or negatively).</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>
<p>The core of the design cycle relies on feedback. If you do not complete something on time, then it offsets the entire cycle. In a real job, you <em>must</em> have something to present to your client. I expect the same from you. As a result, I will not accept late assignments. While special circumstances may warrant an extension, failing to complete an assignment in time to present it or get feedback will result either in a 0 or a grade of no more than <em>half</em> your final grade on the the assignment.</p>

<p><strong>If you cannot complete an assignment,</strong> you should turn in whatever work that you have completed along with a reflection on the assignment (Why couldn’t you finish it? What was harder than you expected?). I will provide a standard Google Form on our website for this submission.</p>

<h2 id="special-accommodations">Special Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you have a physical, mental or learning disability, either hidden or visible, which may require classroom, test-taking, or other reasonable modifications, please see your Associate Dean as soon as possible. If you have been granted special accommodations, please inform your instructors in a timely manner (a week before accommodations are needed would be considered timely). Any student who may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Director of the Office of Accessibility Resources at 570-577-1188.</p>
